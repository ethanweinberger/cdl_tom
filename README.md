# Drone ToM

## Goal

The goal of this project is to develop a machine theory of mind to describe the agents 
observed in the Stanford Drone Dataset (SDD).  

## TODO:

* Finish writing/adapting Observer class
	* Can we get an observer to predict the actions of agents in our movies?
* How to represent actions in the world?
	* Can't be so clean as 1 frame = move in 1 of 8 directions
	* Take the diff between consecutive positions?
