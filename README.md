# Drone ToM

## Instructions

To run an instance of the GridWorldMDP use the command "python3 planning_example.py".  This will load a map as described in the planning_example.py file and our agent will attempt to move to the corresponding goal object.  To tune the "intelligence" of the agent, the variable tau in Planner.py can be modified.  Higher tau leads to a worse performing agent while lower tau leads to better performance.
